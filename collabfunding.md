## How to get paid for a Cobudget Bucket

First, you need to figure out whether you're invoicing Enspiral Services or Enspiral Foundation. See the [Venture Profiles](http://handbook.enspiral.com/venture_profiles.html) if you're not sure.

Then, if your work was for Foundation, fill out [this form first](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdr9pugQocyDm28R0he71za00bfLQ80Azgff9flSzKjpjFwog/viewform)

If your work was for an Enspiral Services bucket, email services@enspiral.com with an invoice that includes:
* the total amount for the bucket
* a clear indication whether GST is included in your invoice (remember the Cobudget amounts are GST-exclusive)
* your name, contact email and bank account number
* whether you are invoicing for you personally or on behalf of an Enspiral venture
* the web address and name of the Cobudget bucket.
